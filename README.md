INTRODUCTION :

The event management sector faces numerous operational challenges, including disorganized workflows, dependency on manual processes, and the growing need for a streamlined user experience. To address these issues, the Event Management System (EMS) project was developed, offering a scalable and dynamic web application designed to automate key processes, enhance efficiency, and provide a seamless interface for admins, organizers,vendors, and clients alike.
Based on role-based access control, the EMS ensures tailored functionality for different user roles such as Super Admin, Admin, and Sub Admin, each with access to specific modules and capabilities. The intuitive dashboard design provides users with a bird's-eye view of critical statistics and operations, allowing for efficient management and tracking of events.

Key features of this system include :

1.Hotel booking and event scheduling to streamline planning.
2.Vendor and catering service management to ensure smooth coordination.
3.Role-based access control for enhanced data security and user-specific access.
4.Dynamic dashboards showcasing mini-statistics such as total users, bookings, events, hotels, caterings, and cancellations for quick insights.

During my internship, I leveraged industry-standard tools and frameworks such as Java Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, JSP, and CSS to design and implement this robust solution. This hands on experience not only strengthened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively, solve complex problems, and deliver high-quality projects within  deadlines

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Managing events such as weddings, birthdays, and corporate gatherings requires coordinating multiple components, including user registrations, scheduling, resource allocation, and service coordination. Traditional methods relying on manual processes and spreadsheets are often inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming, making it challenging to streamline workflows and ensure customer satisfaction. This project addresses key challenges by implementing a secure login and signup system for role-based access by users, sub-admins, super-admins, and admins. It provides real-time updates on available venues, catering options, and vendors, enabling seamless event booking. Additionally, the system empowers admins and organizers with tools to efficiently manage schedules, resources, and feedback while maintaining clear role-based responsibilities. To enhance user experience, the platform transparently displays service charges, facilitating informed decision-making and improving overall efficiency.

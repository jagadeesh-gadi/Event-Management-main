Introduction

The event management sector faces numerous operational challenges, including disorganized
workflows, dependency on manual processes, and the growing need for a streamlined user
experience. To address these issues, the Event Management System (EMS) project was
developed, offering a scalable and dynamic web application designed to automate key
processes, enhance efficiency, and provide a seamless interface for admins, organizers,
vendors, and clients alike.
Based on role-based access control, the EMS ensures tailored functionality for different user
roles such as Super Admin, Admin, and Sub Admin, each with access to specific modules and
capabilities. The intuitive dashboard design provides users with a bird's-eye view of critical
statistics and operations, allowing for efficient management and tracking of events.
Key features of this system include:
 Hotel booking and event scheduling to streamline planning.
 Vendor and catering service management to ensure smooth coordination.
 Role-based access control for enhanced data security and user-specific access.
 Dynamic dashboards showcasing mini-statistics such as total users, bookings, events,
hotels, caterings, and cancellations for quick insights.
During my internship, I leveraged industry-standard tools and frameworks such as Java Spring
Boot, JPA/Hibernate, JSP, and CSS to design and implement this robust solution. This handson experience not only strengthened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to
collaborate effectively, solve complex problems, and deliver high-quality projects within
deadlines
